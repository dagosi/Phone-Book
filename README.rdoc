== Welcome to a Real Time Phone Book

See me runing at: http://real-time-phonebook.herokuapp.com/

This phone book stores contacts and numbers in a real-time environment. Hence, you can add, delete, and update contacts with other people at the same time without reloading the page.

The client side was developed in Backbone with CoffeeScript, and the server is runing in Rails(of course).
